# AMD prediction

The code loads the trained weights and a sample dataset, and predicts the AMD progression. Finally, it computes the preformance as AUC ROC.

## Dependencies needed

1. Python 3
2. NLTK
3. Pandas
4. sklearn
5. keras with tensorflow
6. matplotlib

## Execution (Very simple running!! Trust me)

1. unzip weights
2. Run the Testing_OCT.py from terminal as: python Testing_OCT
3. And that's it!! It will predict the outcome and plot the AUC ROC for 3 months and 21 months prediction.
